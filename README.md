Practical Assessment: Asset Management

In this example, I will assist in designing a process to capture assets and maintain an up-to-date CMDB. Goodcorp, a medical research company, currently uses a single spreadsheet that has some ad-hoc IT systems details: 

An internal auditing firm has conducted its first cybersecurity internal audit for Goodcorp, and a significant finding was that the Asset Management process needs urgent enhancements. The firm noted that Goodcorp needs to handle asset management better. They indicated that Goodcorp needs an up-to-date central asset management database. 

Recommendations:
-	Leverage the current spreadsheet used as a CMBD. Use it as a starting point and improve it as you go. 

-	Conduct an asset discovery activity. This can first be accomplished by scanning the network and comparing the findings with the current list. 

-	Collaborate with the IT team to validate the current CMDB assets. If discrepancies are found, update the CMDB accordingly. The IT team is a great source for a list of software and hardware assets. 

-	Meet with stakeholders to thoroughly understand each team's intellectual property research, as intellectual property research is Goodcorp's most critical asset. 

-	Meet with stakeholders from the rest of the business to validate the assets documented in the CMDB. 

-	Classify the assets based on sensitivity and criticality. 

-	Document a process within the spreadsheet that ensures the CMDB is maintained and up to date. Recommend that the IT team maintain the CMDB. The IT team should have a process to review and validate the CMDB periodically. A review every 6 to 12 months is acceptable, depending on the workload. 

-	Document the roles and responsibilities of maintaining and reviewing the CMDB and ensure that senior management endorses and supports the process.
